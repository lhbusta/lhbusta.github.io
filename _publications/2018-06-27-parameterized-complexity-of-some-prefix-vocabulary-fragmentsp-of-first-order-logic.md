We analyze the parameterized complexity of the satisfiability problem for some prefix-vocabulary fragments of First-order Logic with the finite model property. Here we examine three natural parameters: the quantifier rank, the vocabulary size and the maximum arity of relation symbols. Following the classical classification of decidable prefix-vocabulary fragments, we will see that, for all relational classes of modest complexity and some classical classes, fixed-parameter tractability is achieved by using the above cited parameters.
